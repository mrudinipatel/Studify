# Studify ðŸ“–

Studify is a study app that helps students improve learning and better manage multiple course loads. Studify is designed with organization in mind, serving as an all-in-one shop for all studying needs.


## App features ðŸ§®

Studify offers a hierarchical content management system that allows users to organize notes by course and topic. It also contains additional useful features such as AI-math animations, a pomodoro study timer, quizzes and flashcards, note sharing, academic references, and calender.
 
The app delivers a customized experience through its user-account system and accessibility settings which include dark and light modes, language support, and font size adjustments.

Students from any discipline can use Studify to consolidate information from various courses into a single hub to improve time management, organization, and knowledge retention. Math students, in particular, will largely benefit from Studify's AI animations feature and find great use in enhancing their understanding of mathematical concepts.

Please note: I did not demo the generation of AI-math animations nor quizzes and flashcards, as it takes a lil while and GitHub's readme-embedded videos need to be a certain size so I can't have the videos be too long :3
